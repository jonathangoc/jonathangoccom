Why I Chose Hugo There are mainly four reasons why I used Hugo to build my personal website.
Open-source. Hugo is an open-source technology that allows anyone to create a static site. Therefore, the code is maintained by a community of developers and other contributors which consequently will make it performant and more secure.</description>
