      <description>Intro In this blog post, I will explain how to create a NetStorage (NS) Group, how to upload content to NetStorage using FileZilla and how to create a simple Akamai Delivery Property.
What’s Hot? Have you checked the previous Your Application at the Edge [S01E01] blog post? If you are curious about the reason why the series exist, then go and have a look at the first blog post.
Context Before we crack on with the NS implementation I would like to give a high-level overview of the scenario.</description>

How do you improve the delivery of a Website or Application using the solutions available in Akamai?
And have you ever thought about the challenges and pain points that you might have to face when using Akamai’s solutions?
These are the questions that have been floating in my mind for a while and I will try to address them from a technical perspective throughout the series of blog posts.</description>
